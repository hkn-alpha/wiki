# PHYS214

[PHYS214 (University Physics: Quantum Physics)](../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS214.md) is a 2-credit hour, 8-week long course that is required for ECE majors as a part of the Foundational Mathematics and Science requirement.

## Who Should Take the Exam

For students who have a solid physics background or who want to finish the class early, they should take the proficiency exam. There is no penalty for failing the PHYS214 proficiency exam. If you fail the exam, you can still take the class.

## Content Covered

- Waves and Interference
- Wave Function
- Momentum and Position
- Eigenstates
- Oscillators
- HBand structure

## Exam Format

The exam consists of both multiple choice and fill in the blank questions given through Prairietest at CBTF. The content is similar to that of the class's final exams. The assigned grade is Pass or Fail. An 80% score is required to receive a passing grade. A electronic formula sheet will be given in the exam. The exam is also used as a makeup exam for students who missed the final exam in a previous semester. 

## How to Prepare

Lecture recordings are available on [media space](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/channel/Physics+214+Summer+2020/165144871). Register for the PHYS214 proficiency exam through Physics department's [proficiency exam website](https://physics.illinois.edu/academics/courses/proficiency-exams). A few weeks before the proficiency exam, you will find a class on PrairieLearn labeled "PHYS 214: University Physics Quantum & Modern, PHYS 214 Study Exams." The study exams on PrarieLearn is very similar to the actual exam. They are the best tool to study.

## Life After

For ECE students who are interested in photonic devices or semiconductor, they can take [ECE304](../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE304.md) and [ECE340](../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE340.md) after passing the PHYS214 proficiency exam. You may also want to take a look at the [PHYS213 proficiency exam](). [PHYS213](../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS213.md) is another 2-credit hour, 8-week long required class for ECE majors. It's typically taken in the same semester as PHYS214. 

If you didn't pass the PHYS214 proficiency exam, don't take it as a reflection of your skills. Your efforts to study the material before the semester will pay dividends and you will have an easier time than other students taking PHYS214.
