# CHEM102

CHEM102 is the first course in chemistry required for only for electrical engineering majors. It is a 3 credit hour course that introduces basic chemistry that expose students to topics like chemical bonding, chemical reactions, stoichiochemistry, periodic table, Equilibrium, Thermodynamics, ect. 

# Content Covered 

These are the topics typically covered in the lectrures and tested on the exams.

- Atomic Structure
- Electromagnetic Radiation
- Bohr Model of the atom
- Quantum Mechanical Model of the atom
- Chemical bonds
- Lewis Structures, octet	rule and exceptions, resonance and formal charge
- VSEPR model
- Lewis structures of organic	molecules
- Hybridization model
- Intermolecular Forces and Physical Properties
- Stoichiometry
- Electrolytes and Precipitation reactions
- Gases Laws and properties of ideal and non-ideal gases
- Bond Energy
- Lattice	Energy
- Chemical Equilibrium	
- Solubility Equilibria
- Acid-Base Reactions
- Thermodynamics
- Redox Reactions
- Electrochemistry

# Prerequisits

The prerequisits for this course are - Credit in or exemption from MATH 112; one year of high school chemistry or equivalent. Normally these are ruled out, making it the first and only course in the chemistry sequence required for electrical engineering majors.

# When to take it

This course is a freshman level course typically taken in the first semester. However there are not many higher level ECE courses that require CHEM 102 as a prerequisit. Thus there is a flexibility in when to take this course. 

# Course Structure

This course uses Lon-Capa as their official course webpage. The course has weekly discussions, homeworks, 6 quizes and 3 midterms throughout the semester. There is a final exam for this course. Lecture attendance is not required, however important notices regarding quizes are usually given during the lecture. 

The weekly homeworks and quizzes are posted on lon-capa. these can be free response or mcq questions. The quizzes can be taken over a duration of 3 days. These can be taken at home. The three midterms administered over the course of the semester are hour exams having multiple choice questions. 

# Course Instructors

Professor Hummel teaches this course along with TAs running the discussion sections.

# Course Tips

Keeping up with the material is crucial for this course. Doing the weekly homeworks and quizzes help to review and prepare for the exam. The provided textbook for this course is really helpful to understand some of the topics. Also, the problems from the textbook are a really good resourse to practice help you to prepare for the exams. 

# Life After 

This is the last course in chemistry required for electrical engineering majors. However if interested, you can take CHEM 104, the subsequent course in the sequence. [CHEM 104](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2025/spring/CHEM/104)
