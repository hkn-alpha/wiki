# Systems and Networking, 7 Semesters

## About Me

I am an Illinois resident graduating with a BS in Computer Engineering in Fall 2024 and heading off to industry. I don't have much research experience or interest up my belt, and my schedule is a lot more obscure than others'. I did not immediately know what I wanted to do; I came here wanting to go into software but didn't know which specializations I liked. I chose many different technical electives, resulting in a rather odd schedule. I also struggled with what RSOs I wanted to do. The reason for this partly aligned with the fact that I didn't know what specialization I wanted to go into, and also because I am just a person that prioritizes schoolwork too much over personal projects and experience. I was drilled with a "straight-A" mindset throughout high school, and that carried into college. In addition, the COVID pandemic limited my options and diminished my motivation to get involved. It took many semesters for me to decide what I am interested in and how I wanted to get involved with the ECE community. I had two software internships at the same (relatively small) company, which overall wasn't an impressive start to my introduction to industry, but gave me a good basis to show my experience for my eventual full-time position. I took many APs in high school, which allowed me to graduate in 3.5 years. Overall, unlike most students in ECE at UIUC, I didn't immediately know what I wanted to do, resulting in some outcomes that I wish played differently.

## Features of this Schedule

As mentioned, this schedule consists of many odd classes and combinations and is different from the "recommended" track for CompEs. The general trend here is that my Fall semesters were very tough, while my Spring semesters were a lot more chill. The takeaway from my schedule is that you should definitely consider what you want to do and do research on courses and schedules before you finalize your semester plan (which is what this wiki is for!). Doing this allows you to make the most of your college **learning** experience. However, make sure to surround yourself with people who support you and can hang out with you in troubled times too. Hang out at the gym, eat lunch together, or just go for a walk every now and then. Spend the first year of your college career forming a close friend group and find people with shared interests. Evaluate your overall capability from your first two semesters and try to take as many courses as you can **within reasonable limits**. Don't overstretch yourself too much, but also don't be afraid to take tougher schedules. You can always drop a class before the deadline.

I managed to get the sufficient scores to earn credit for Calculus I and II and for Physics Mechanics and E&M. I took AP Calculus BC in my junior year of high school, and my high school had a dual-credit program with Eastern Illinois University, allowing me to take Calc III in the fall of my senior year and Differential Equations in the spring of my senior year and transfer the credit to UIUC. This saved me a ton of time in taking the foundational mathematics classes and allowed me to finish up my gen-eds quickly. I also took AP CSA and AP CSP and a Java class at a community college (which got me credit for CS125) and AP PSYCH and AP Music Theory, which earned me some gen-ed credit. I'm grateful that I came in with so many credits. This helped in graduating a semester early.

This semester didn't feel like a semester for computer engineering; it felt like another high school semester. I had originally wanted to take [PHYS213](../../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS213.md) and [PHYS214](../../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS213.md) in place of REL104, but the seats filled up very quickly, and having finished most of my math requirements except for [MATH257](../../Course%20Wiki/MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH257.md) and already having registered for it, I decided to take another gen-ed. I didn't want to take [CS173](../Course%20Wiki/CS%20Course%20Offerings/CS173.md) because I saw that it was typically taken in sophomore fall semesters, so I worried it was a stretch for me, but I wish I had just taken it then, especially since I had CS125, which was a valid prerequisite for the course. The gen-eds I took were much harder than what gen-eds should be; they were a lot of boring reading and essay-writing, and I had to put a lot of time in these gen-eds. [ECE120](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE120.md) was a new take on computing for me, because the main computing experience I had from high school was mobile-app development and AP CSA, and I never studied anything as low-level as digital logic and hardware design. The course was easy for me in the first half but got much harder in the second half. I ultimately choked on the third midterm and the final exam, which sunk me from an A to an A-. I generally didn't like the class due to not being able to understand the professor and because of my sour experience on the exams. Overall, this semester was a lot harder than it should've been from a glance, because my gen-eds were a lot of work. Thankfully, this was at a time when I actually cared about gen-eds, so I passed those courses with flying colors and got my Humanities and Advanced Composition requirements out of the way. I became involved with Illini Ridgebacks Quidditch (later renamed Quadball), which was a super fun sport, and I would stick with the team for the next two years. I also met my first college friends in ENG100, which cemented my friend group.

#### Tips 

Pace out your gen-eds instead of trying to get them out of the way before technical classes. Gen-eds can be taken at anytime without prerequisite requirements, but technical classes have a prerequisite sequence to them, and delaying them can delay other courses that you can unlock. Also, try to get involved in something that sounds remotely interesting to you and would be good to mention in an interview or your resume. Better yet, try to stick with it and/or join the same RSO/club as your friends. I tried to join SIGMusic and SIGGameBuilders my freshman year, but I didn't do anything with those clubs. I also wished I joined the same clubs as my friends, because our time together became limited in our later semesters. Finding what you enjoy and appreciate can take time, and it's good to start early but also ok if you find you don't enjoy it. Join a non-technical RSO too. You'll find yourself making friends with people in different majors and becoming well-versed. I don't regret joining the Illini Ridgebacks, but it might have been interesting to join CLAID too, as I am a Chinese-American.
