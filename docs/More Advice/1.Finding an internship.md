### 1. Return on Investment: Why Intern?  
* **Competitive Pay:** 2024 UIUC ECE interns reported a **median $34 /hr** (range $22‑$52).  
* **Faster Full‑Time Offers:** 72 % of interns convert to return offers within 3 months.  
* **Skill Acceleration:** hands‑on exposure to toolchains (Cadence, Quartus, TensorRT) that classes mention once.  
* **Clearer Career Path:** test hardware vs. software vs. research before committing to a full‑time track.

### 6. Networking That Works  
* **Elevator Pitch Template:** *“Hi, I’m <Name>, a UIUC ECE junior focusing on embedded ML. Last semester I built <X> that <impact>. I’m excited about <Company>’s <project/team>. Could you share more about intern roles?”*  
* **Informational Interview Flow:** Intro → Curiosity about career path → Insightful question → Thank‑you + connect on LinkedIn.  
* **Professor Research Leads:** Visit office hours with a 1‑page project proposal; ask about joining their ECE 396/397 group.  
* **Relationship Tracking:** Spreadsheet (Date, Contact, Next Steps). Update monthly.

<a name="ats"></a>
### 7. ATS 101: Beating the Bots  
* **Keywords:** Mirror top 10 nouns & verbs from job description (e.g., *“UART”, “Verilog”, “debug”*).  
* **No Fancy Formatting:** avoid text boxes, columns, graphics; use standard section headers.  
* **File Type:** PDF unless portal demands DOCX.  
* **Validation Tools:** Jobscan.ai (free via ECS), Rezi.ai (2 free exports).  
* **Common Rejection Reasons:** missing graduation date, GPA omitted, unreadable font.

### 8. Online Assessments (OAs)  
| Track | Topics | Practice Resources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **EE (Hardware)** | Thevenin/Norton, BJT biasing, op‑amp stability, MOSFET switching, EMI | All About Circuits quizzes, ECE 329 labs, Glassdoor \*Company\* Qs |
| **CE (Embedded/Systems)** | FSMs, cache misses, pipelining, RTOS scheduling, C bit‑manipulation | Nand2Tetris, Patterson slides, Intel FPGA Workshops |
| **CS (Software)** | Arrays/Hashmaps, BFS/DFS, DP, sorting, graphs, concurrency | Grind 75, NeetCode 150, CodeSignal arcade |

**Training Schedule (6 weeks):**  
`Mon‑Thu` 2 problems/day → `Fri` timed mock OA → `Sat` review + notes → `Sun` rest.

**Proctoring Tips:**  
* Use wired keyboard/mouse; disable notifications.  
* Keep scratch paper in camera frame.  
* Re‑read constraints before coding.

### 9. Interview Mastery  
#### 9.1 Behavioral  
* **STAR‑L:** Situation → Task → Action → Result → *Learning*.  
* Prepare 5 core stories (leadership, conflict, failure, technical win, innovation).  
* Research leadership principles (Amazon, Rivian) and weave them naturally.  
* End with 2‑3 tailored questions (team culture, project roadmap).

#### 9.2 Technical  
| Track | What They Ask | How to Prepare |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **EE** | Draw a Fly‑back converter; explain duty cycle. | ECE 342 notes, TI Power Lab |
| **CE** | Design 4‑way set associative cache; calc hit rate. | ECE 411, Logisim practice |
| **CS** | Insert/Delete/GetRandom O(1) design; code it live. | LeetCode ‑ Mediums, talk aloud |

**System Design (CE/CS):**  
1. Clarify requirements → 2. Draw high‑level block diagram → 3. Deep‑dive a component → 4. Bottlenecks & trade‑offs → 5. Summarize.

**Virtual Setup:**  
* Ethernet, 1080p cam, good lighting.  
* White‑board app (Excalidraw) for diagrams.  
* Mute Slack/email.

**Follow‑up Email Template:**  
> *Subject:* Thank you — {Role} Interview  
> *Body:* 3‑sentence thank‑you, one technical takeaway, reiterate enthusiasm.

### 10. Evaluating & Negotiating Offers  
| Factor | What to Check |
| --- | --- |
| **Pay** | Hourly rate, overtime rules, housing stipend, sign‑on bonus |
| **Project Scope** | Ownership level, mentor availability, technologies used |
| **Location** | Cost of living, public transit, company housing |
| **Return Offer Likelihood** | Historical conversion %, opportunity for part‑time remote |

**UIUC Offer Policy:** ECS‑participating companies must give ≥ 3 weeks to decide. Politely cite this if pressured.

**Negotiation Steps:**  
1. Express excitement → 2. Present market data (ECS salary survey) → 3. Ask if rate is flexible → 4. Stop talking.

### 11. International Student Checklist  
1. **Curricular Practical Training (CPT)**: must be integral to degree → register for ECE 298/397 if needed.  
2. **Timeline:** Apply 10 weeks before start; ISSS requires job offer + advisor letter.  
3. **Co‑op Option:** preserves F‑1 status; allows 8‑12‑month paid rotation.  
4. **SSN & I‑9:** apply within first week of work.  
5. **Travel:** need new I‑20 signature if re‑entering US during internship.

### 12. Special Scenarios  
* **Freshmen:** target *Explore‑style* programs (Google STEP, Meta PE, Microsoft Explore). Focus on RSOs + personal projects.  
* **BS/MS 5‑Year:** highlight grad‑level coursework; pursue advanced research internships (Intel Labs, NVIDIA Research).  
* **Research‑to‑Industry Switch:** translate publications to *impact bullets*; link code/data in portfolio.  
* **Hardware‑Only Aspirants:** prioritize Co‑op, Research Park hardware teams (John Deere, ADM).
